What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing?

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for integrating applications.
CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.
This is useful because complex applications often reference third-party APIs and resources in their client-side code.
For example, your application may use your browser to pull videos from a video platform API,
use fonts from a public font library, or display weather data from a national weather database.



CORS allows the client browser to check with the third-party servers if the request is authorized before any data transfers.
